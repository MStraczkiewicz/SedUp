# SedUp
Process a raw accelerometry signal collected using wrist-worn wearable 
device into sedentary and standing indicator.

The method used in this script is called SedUp, short for "sedentary and 
upright body posture classification method". SedUp determines body 
posture using the raw measurement of acceleration transformed into two 
statistical metrics, i.e., median acceleration and median of standard 
deviation of acceleration, and a logistic regression.

Detailed method description was published in:
M. Straczkiewicz, N.W. Glynn, V. Zipunnikov, J. Harezlak, Fast and robust 
algorithm for detecting body posture using wrist-worn accelerometer,
Journal for the Measurement of Physical Behaviour, 2020.
